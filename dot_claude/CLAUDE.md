# Global Instructions

## Git commits
- Do NOT add a co-author line (e.g. `Co-Authored-By: ...`) to git commits unless explicitly asked to.

## Testing (all languages)
- Use Given/When/Then comments in tests to document test structure:
  ```
  // Given <initial state or preconditions>
  // When <action being tested>
  // Then <expected outcome>
  ```
